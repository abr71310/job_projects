Hi there!

Sometimes I get asked intriguing questions in an interview, for which the answer is not obvious.
Even if you search Google after the interview, you can't seem to find an answer.

Well, this github (for me) tries to solve it.
It might not be pretty or efficient, but dangit, it worked for what I needed it for!

Here's a brief rundown of what I coded, and what it does.
* "findNextPrime.java": outputs the next prime, given a number to start on. **OPTIMAL SOLUTION**
* "findNextPrimeBigInt.java": outputs next prime, given a number to start on. (> 64-bit numbers)

As always, YMMV!
