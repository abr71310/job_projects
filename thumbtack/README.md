# Simple Database Challenge solution #
## By: Michael Shao ##

To run, simply type "python database-challenge.py".

If you wish to pipe files as input, try "python database-challenge.py < [in-file]"

If you wish to pipe files as output, try "python database-challenge.py > [out-file]"

If you wish to pipe files as input AND output, try "python database-challenge.py < [in-file] > [out-file]"

The test inputs included are as follows (from the challenge document):
* in1.txt
* in2.txt
* in3.txt
* in4.txt
* in5.txt

The test inputs after in5.txt are my own special edge cases:
* in6.txt
* in7.txt
* in8.txt

The outputs all correspond to the input files, with the format "out[#].txt".

The intention behind this was to ensure consistency when testing.
