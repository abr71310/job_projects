# Simple Database Challenge solution #
## By: Michael Shao ##

To run, simply type "python database-challenge.py".  
If you wish to pipe files as input, try "python database-challenge.py < [in-file]"  
If you wish to pipe files as output, try "python database-challenge.py > [out-file]"  
If you wish to pipe files as input AND output, try "python database-challenge.py < [in-file] > [out-file]"

The test inputs included are as follows (from the challenge document):
* in1.txt
* in2.txt
* in3.txt
* in4.txt
* in5.txt
* in6.txt

The test inputs after in6.txt are my own special edge cases:
* in7.txt
* in8.txt
* in9.txt

The outputs all correspond to the input files, with the format "out[#].txt".  
The intention behind this was to ensure consistency when testing.  
Side note: I am not well-versed in Python, so my code is not as well-optimized as I had wanted.  

Also, to whoever is marking this: I didn't see the e-mail sent to me dated January 19th until this last Friday (February 6).  
I hope it's still OK that I'm submitting this (extremely late, since it said only take a week!) now.
