To run the following files, preface with "javac" (to compile), then type "java <program>" to run.

It will automatically target the corresponding files specified: wordlist.java-->wordlist.txt and brackets.txt-->brackets.txt

The commands are as follows:

To run wordlist (problem 1):
"javac wordlist.java"
"java wordlist"

It automatically either overwrites, or writes to "wordlist-substituted.txt".

To run brackets (problem 2):
"javac brackets.java"
"java brackets"

It automatically either overwrites, or writes to "brackets-matched.txt".

Thanks for allowing me this opportunity.
Sorry for brute-forcing problem 1.
